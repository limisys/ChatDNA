# ChatDNA
Complete decoding of human genetic mapping DNA by GPT model.
语言模型的发展，使得“人工生命”变得非常迫切，紧急！
生命的秘密，全部都在基因密码中，那么，我的DNA里，到底写了哪些信息？这需要一个“对话”，让DNA自己来讲述碱基对里，记录的故事，这听上去是一个很不错的主意么？如果这是一个好主意，那我们就可以用一个“CHAT”程序，来实现对生命的理解，对基因的解码，也就不再惧怕“数字生命”！
The development of language models has made "artificial life" very urgent and urgent!
The secrets of life are all in the genetic code, so what information is written in my DNA? Does it sound like a good idea to have a "conversation" and let the DNA itself tell the story recorded in the base pairs? If this is a good idea, then we can use a "CHAT" program to understand life, to decode genes, and to stop being afraid of "digital life"!
